where can i find the github link to give in resume
Copilot
It seems like there isn't a specific GitHub repository for the Rockefeller Sales Analysis project available publicly. If you've created this project yourself, you can create a GitHub repository and upload your project files there. Here’s how you can do it:

Create a GitHub Account: If you don't already have one, sign up for a GitHub account.

Create a New Repository: Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository." Give your repository a name, add a description, and make it public if you want others to see it.

Upload Files: Follow the instructions to upload your project files (e.g., Power BI files, SQL scripts, data files).

Generate a Link: Once your repository is set up and files are uploaded, you can generate a link to share. The URL will look something like this: https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.

Would you like more detailed instructions on any of these steps?
